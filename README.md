# DataVisualization_final_project
Based on my project, users could perform tasks such as comparing the average precipitation of
different cities, identifying which months have the highest and lowest precipitation levels, and
observing any trends or patterns in precipitation over time.
Here are some specific examples:
1. As a meteorologist, I want to compare the average precipitation of different cities so that
I can determine which areas have higher or lower precipitation levels.
2. As a city planner, I want to identify which months have the highest and lowest
precipitation levels so that I can prepare for potential flooding or drought conditions.
3. As a researcher, I want to observe any trends or patterns in precipitation over time so
that I can better understand the impact of climate change on precipitation patterns.
Design Overview
The design overview of the precipitation data visualization is centered around providing an
easy-to-understand interface for users to explore and visualize precipitation data. The
visualization is designed to be accessible to a range of users, from researchers and analysts to
students and hobbyists.
Overall, the design of the precipitation data visualization is intended to facilitate the exploration
and understanding of precipitation patterns and trends over time. It enables users to easily
compare precipitation levels across cities, identify months with high or low precipitation, and
visualize any trends or patterns in precipitation over time.
